# Student Manager – React CRUD Table

A simple frontend application built with React that allows users to manage student records using basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic table interface where users can add, edit, and delete student data directly from the browser without using a backend server. All data is handled on the frontend using local state.
